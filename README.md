# Holiday Demand Forecasting

**Holiday season demand forecasting model for retail stores using Python and Prophet.**

During the holiday season, retailers face challenges like overstock and stockouts due to unpredictable spikes in customer demand (Black Friday, Thanksgiving, Christmas). This project simulates this problem and demonstrates a **mini demand forecasting solution**.

## Project Highlights

- **Demand Forecasting:** Predict weekly sales for multiple products across multiple stores using Prophet.
- **Inventory Risk Analysis:** Identify products at risk of overstock or stockout based on predicted demand.
- **Visualizations:** 
  - Heatmap showing predicted demand across stores and products.
  - Line chart comparing predicted sales vs current inventory for a single product/store.
- **Synthetic Data:** Sample dataset simulating multiple stores, products, promotions, and holiday effects. Can be replaced with real company data.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/holi-demand-forecasting.git
2. Open the Holiday_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Install dependencies (if needed):
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn prophet

**Optional**: Open in Colab in needed
